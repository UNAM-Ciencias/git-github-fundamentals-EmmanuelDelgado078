# :smiley: This is what I learned :nerd_face:

In this lesson I learned that **Git** and **Github** are different but *complementary* tools. 
On the one hand, Git is a version controller and GitHub is the online platform that allows you to work collaboratively with more people using Git.
I also learned the basic commands to create repositories and also, 
I added my **personal readme** which is the description of my profile. 
It is something I had never done before and I consider important for people who visit it. 
Fortunately I didn't get confused with anything so far. :sunglasses:
